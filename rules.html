        5. in relation to Main Prizes and Secondary Prizes only, if you do not claim your Prize and finalise the arrangements for payment by 17:59 UTC on the day of the relevant Prize Draw, the Prize will go back to Usecurious, whereupon you will lose all and any claim to it. <br>

        1. modify the Prize Draw in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of the Official Rules without suspending it; <br>

    3. Usecurious reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Prize Draw or to be acting in violation of the Official Rules from participation in any Prize Draw.  Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of any part of any Prize Draw may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Usecurious reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Usecurious’s failure to enforce any term of the Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.  In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.  In the event there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in any Usecurious-related materials and these Official Rules, these Official Rules shall prevail. <br><br>
