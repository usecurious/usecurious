1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS <br><br>
    1. Usecurious provides its prize draw promotion service (the “Service“) to you, subject to these Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”), the Official Rules and our Privacy Policy, and any other documents referred to therein. The Official Rules and the Privacy Policy are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference and form part of these Terms of Service. <br>
    2. By accessing or using the Site, the App and/or the Service, you confirm that you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. <br>
    3. These Terms of Service may be updated from time to time by Usecurious. All changes will be posted on the Site. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time and the Official Rules on the Site. Your continued use of the Service, the App or the Site after any such changes have been made constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. <br>
    4. If you do not agree to comply with these or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Service, the App or the Site. <br><br>
2. THE SERVICE <br><br>
    1. The Service is a web-based prize draw promotion which is free to enter. One prize draw promotion (each a “Prize Draw”) is held per day where users have the opportunity to win: 
        1. a cash prize of at least £100 or $100, (a “Jackpot”); or <br>
        2. multiple cash prizes worth up to an aggregate amount of £100 or $100, (each a “Main Prize” or together “Main Prizes”); or <br>
        3. where users are unsuccessful in winning either a Jackpot or a Main Prize, other cash prizes, if made available to users by Usecurious (each a “Secondary Prize” or together “Secondary Prizes”);together the “Prizes” and each individually a “Prize”. <br>
    2. The Prizes which will be available to win on any given day will be notified to users via the App or Site, prior to entering the Prize Draw. It is not guaranteed that a Jackpot, Main Prizes and Secondary Prize will be made available each day and there may be some days where only a Jackpot or Main Prizes are made available to win. Users will be able to play for Secondary Prizes where such Secondary Prizes are made available by Usecurious to Users. <br>
    3. In order to enter a Prize Draw, users (each a “User”) must register for an account with Usecurious, either through our App. Upon entering a Prize Draw in accordance with the Official Rules, the User’s details will be entered into a database along with the other Users who have entered that Prize Draw, from which: <br>
        1. one User in respect of a Jackpot; or <br>
        2. a fluctuating number of Users in respect of Main Prizes; and <br>
        3. a fluctuating number of users in respect of the Secondary Prizes; <br>
are chosen automatically and randomly at 09:30:00am Universal Time Coordinated (“UTC”) the following day during weekdays, during weekends the time shall be 02:30:00pm UTC the following day, depending upon the Prizes made available to win on the day of the Prize Draw concerned. The Users chosen automatically in clauses 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 together shall each be a “Winner”.<br>
    1. Each Winner is entitled to receive a Prize, as applicable depending upon whether the Winner concerned has won a Jackpot, a Main Prize or a Secondary Prize (subject to the Official Rules). Except where prohibited, each Prize Winner consents to appearing in any media (including on Usecurious’s Winner’s Wall referred to in Clause 12 of the Official Rules, on social media and any Usecurious owned website (including the App)). <br>
    2. Users must not enter any Prize Draw more than once and must not register for more than one account with Usecurious. Each entry is valid for one Prize Draw only and you may enter only one Prize Draw per day. An entry into a Prize Draw shall entitle a User to play for the Jackpot and/or Main Prizes as applicable and, if unsuccessful, a Secondary Prize as applicable depending upon the availability of Prizes as notified to Users before choosing to enter a Prize Draw. <br>
    3. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new feature that is added to the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Service.
